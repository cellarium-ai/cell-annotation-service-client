Such a call _can_ be made, however, with the understanding that the notion of the best cell type call for any given cell is **not** a well-defined task in general. Crude ontology terms (e.g. T cell, B cell) often have higher relevance scores whereas more granular labels (e.g. CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell, IgG-negative class switched memory B cell) often have lower relevance scores. If the _best call_ is construed as _the most confident call_, thensuch a call will be naturally too crude and uninformative. Therefore, there is an inherent trade-off between accuracy and cell type call granularity.\n",

    "We have implemented some basic functionalities to help users navigate the scored ontology graph and make cell type calls. Our current notion of the best cell type call is one that that is furthest away from the root node (here, eukaryotic cell) while having a relevance score above a user-provided threshold. This definition allows us to sort the cell type ontology terms and report the top-_k_ calls for each cell. We show top-3 calls for each cell and each cluster for demonstration."
